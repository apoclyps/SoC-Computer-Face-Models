General 
==================================
PC shows how much it varies between colors. With additional data you can take into account

PC1 - Most Generalised model

---- Variance increases as you go along ( Looks most like a hand)

PC8 - More varied

--- Looks less like a hand


Procrustes Fit
==================================



Colored Data Set
==============================
Alot of variation between the data, alot of clusters, and a lot of mix. You cannot tell the person alone from their hands but you can tell if they are female or male.

Each color is a diffent person - Can you tell which person is which if you worked out the colours. 

No clustering, you cant tell who is who but you can tell who is male or female



Male & Female Data Set
=================================

Male hands are more varied as they are spread out where as there is more of a general clustering of female hands. 

Clear difference if you drew a line, you would probably get about 80% of the data.

More variations betweeen males where as females are not far apart.
